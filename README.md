# My-first-game
    1.first check in I want to start slow and make sure I have a basic test map and
    idea of how I'm going to make my game in the language I choose. 
    2.second check in I want to have sprites and movement for both players and enemies. 
    3.third check in i want to have a main menu and player hud done. 
    4.forth one i want to start getting into the more complicated stuff like health damage, and stamina just overall stats and have them be able to be changed by the player.
    5.fifth check in I want to take a second and do anything I put off and check for errors.
    6.sixth i want more error handling and if i have time add some of the stretch features that i am able to add.
    other.There are going to be things that I'm not going to be able to have an exact time for but plan to complete before the sixth check in and those would be data saving and world growth. What I mean by data saving is saving what progress they made in the world, any items, and the stats that the player chooses to edit.
